This is my week 1 assignment
I have 4 codes on my ipynb file
The first is for operations on 2D lists: Transpose, Product with Transpose and then conversion to a 2x8 matrix
The second is to plot a line graph
The third plots a bar graph
and the fourth plots a pie chart, using matplotlib library module pyplot
